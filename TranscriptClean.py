# TranscriptClean Version 2
# Dana Wyman, 11/20/2017
# In this version of TranscriptClean, mismatches and microindels in long reads are corrected in a SNP-aware fashion using the reference genome and a VCF file of whitelisted variants. Noncanonical splice junctions can also be corrected using a file of reference splice sites as long as the provided SAM file is splice aware.
